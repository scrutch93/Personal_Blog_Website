                        <br>
                        <p> Over the past 2 years I have spent time learning programming. Within those two years I have gotten to learn what best interests me and what doesn't. I found myself more drawn to frontend and the UX design aspects of it. It was here that I realized that I would be best fit into a hybrid role, so I began applying for such roles. Finding unicorn roles is like trying to find an actual unicorn itself, so it was certainly challenging finding that sweet dream spot. By some grace of God, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to interview with a well known gaming company for said position. While I did not get the position, this prompted me to continue to learn more about tools like Unreal Engine and how exactly designs and art are implemented into games in general. 
                        </p>

                        <br>
                        <p> So I guess my overall main goal is to learn technical UI implementation in gaming. However, if I end up become an all around game developer, then that would simply be a massive 1up.

                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                         Today I'll continue to work on an Unreal 2D platformer tutorial that I found on youtube. I had started on this a little while back to prep myself for my interview, so hopefully it won't be to bad diving back in. The video tutorial will be completely code free and just utilizing blueprints. I have read that for faster performance a lot of devs use C++, but for learnings sake I'll go by the blueprint method this tutorial uses.
