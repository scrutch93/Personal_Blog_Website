                        <h3><em> Palletize!</em> </h3>
                        <br>
                        <p> Over the past 3 years I have spent time learning programming. And guess what I learned? That I totally suck at it. However, I am still glad that I decided to take a leap of faith and attempted to become a software dev, because if I didn't, I would still be cursing under my breath at my previous logistics job muttering over and over "how I wish I would've..." The journey hasn't been sunshine and rainbows, as I've hit many dead ends and rough patches along the way. However, I have come closer to meeting and speaking with people in respective fields that I only dreamed of as a child. Putting yourself out there has been incredibly scary and painful, but there have been many rewards that are not immmediately visible. Anyways, I will get off of my soap box and begin diving into a game that I hope to finish...eventually.
                        </p>

                        <br>
                        <p> Enter Palletize. A logistic based game that focus on through-put and revenue. I wanted to make a simple mini game that encompased many aspects of supply chain, but while keeping it to a minimum. This game is meant to pass the time while you are waiting on your next flight, sitting in a patient waiting room, or even at your work desk when you know you should actually be working.

                            I found that there are many games out there that definitely embody supply chain, but they are all very intricate. I want my game to be easy enough for a kid to understand and comprehend but also be addicting to adults, all while teaching basic ideals in supply chain production. Also in this new age of AI, I want implement features that opt to allow speach input for the player to control production through-put.

                           The purpose of this game is for players to maximize as much revenue as they can by neatly sorting falling pallets as efficiently as possible. Each game should only be between 3-5 min long.

                         Scenes and Aesthetics: The goal is to have a retro feel, thus envionment and objects will be pixelated. Main game is set in a warehouse.
